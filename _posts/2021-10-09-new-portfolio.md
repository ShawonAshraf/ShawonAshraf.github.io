title: "Updated portfolio site"
---

I wrote my previous portfolio site in `reactjs`. The problem was that the core components of the site had a lot of outdaed dependencies (yeah, JS) and were getting difficult to maintain and keep updated in the long run. Since I do not need more than a static website as my portfolio, `jekyll` seemed a better fit. This site has been refactored from [LeNPaul/academic](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic)
