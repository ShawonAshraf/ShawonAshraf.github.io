Greetings. I am Shawon Ashraf, currently doing my Masters in Computational Linguistics at IMS, Universit√§t Stuttgart. Previously, I completed my bachelors from North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 

Very recently I have completed a project on Visual Question Answering (on the GQA dataset to be specific), a topic I want to pursue further. I have also started studying Graph Neural Networks and how they can be applied to NLP. Apart from these two, I am actively looking for my masters thesis topic.
