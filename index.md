Greetings. I am Shawon Ashraf, currently doing my Masters in Computational Linguistics at IMS, Universit√§t Stuttgart. Previously, I completed my bachelors from North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 

Very recently I have completed a project on Visual Question Answering (on the GQA dataset to be specific), a topic I want to pursue further. I have also started studying Graph Neural Networks and how they can be applied to NLP. Apart from these two, I am actively looking for my masters thesis topic. 

At IMS, I have worked as a Hlifswissenschaftler (HiWi) for the Programming for Computational Linguistics course at IMS during the Winter 2020-2021 semester. I have been assigned to the role again in Winter  2021-2022.
