## Myself
I completed my Master's in Computational Linguistics from IMS, Universit√§t Stuttgart, Germany and  Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, Bangladesh. I primarily work on language models and their applications. 

I've previously worked as a Software Engineer (Javascript, Swift, SwiftUI) and also as a TA for the Bachelor's and Master's level programming courses at IMS.

Other than work, I write on my blog on topics related to deep learning and natural language processing.
