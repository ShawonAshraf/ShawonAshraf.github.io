## Myself
I am a Junior AI Engineer at [ellamind GmbH](https://ellamind.com/en/). I have a MSc. in Computational Linguistics from IMS, Universit√§t Stuttgart, Germany and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, Bangladesh. I primarily work on language models and their applications. As for programming language, mostly Python. I won't call myself an expert but I can write Pytorch and Jax(+Flax) without asking an LLM Agent. 

I've previously worked as a Software Engineer (Javascript, Swift, SwiftUI) and also as a TA for the Bachelor's and Master's level programming courses at IMS.

Other than work, I write on my blog on Deep Learning and NLP and a few tutorial series which are also on my Github.
